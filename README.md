Project Overview

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) for dynamic spectrum allocation. Secondary users learn to select vacant channels efficiently without interfering with primary users. Both Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) models are implemented to optimize spectrum access.

Key Features

Q-Learning model for single-user spectrum allocation
Deep Q-Network (DQN) for larger and more complex state spaces
Performance analysis in single- and multi-user environments
Identified challenges in multi-agent scenarios and strategies for coordinated learning

Technologies Used

Python for RL modeling and simulation
Reinforcement Learning algorithms: Q-Learning, DQN
Cognitive Radio Network simulation and analysis
